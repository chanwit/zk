        <tabpanel>Tpanel 1 - Testing a long text PETER Costello and Brendan Nelson have attended the opening of the new Senate together, sparking renewed speculation about the former treasurer's future.
Mr Costello, who returned to the backbench after last year's election loss, returned to Parliament this week ahead of the release of his political memoirs next month.

Today he attended the traditional opening of the Senate with Dr Nelson, putting on a show of unity as the pair laughed and joked during ceremony.

Mr Costello is widely believed to be backing Dr Nelson's leadership against any potential challenge by treasury spokesman Malcolm Turnbull.

His dislike of Mr Turnbull has even sparked speculation if Mr Costello was to claim the leadership he may dump Mr Turnbull from the treasury portfolio, providing the key post as a consolation prize to Brendan Nelson if he fell on his sword.

While Mr Costello has ruled out a leadership challenge, his refusal to restate his intention to leave Parliament and pursue a private sector career or discuss whether he would be drafted into the leadership has prompted some MPs to encourage him to put up or shut up.

“I truly believe that Peter has incredible economic credentials and it's not for Peter, but it's for our nation that he should be on the front bench,” Nationals Senator Joyce said.

“But if he doesn't have an intention that way, he should declare it as such.”

Labor's John Hogg was today elected president of the Senate, defeating the only other nomination, Christine Milne, from the Australian Greens.

Today's ceremony was also repeatedly interrupted as another guest SA Labor MP Nick Champion struggled to switch off his mobile phone that filled the chamber with the sound of the cult 1960s television program Hawaii Five-0.</tabpanel>
