	<n:p>I've tested and discover a bug in the comboitems when the combobox is
placed inside an overlapped window.

When you drag the overlapped window within your screen with the items of
the combobox shown, these items remains in the same place instead of moving
with the window.</n:p>
	<window id="win" mode="overlapped" border="normal" width="350px"
	sizable="true">
	<caption label="Hi there!"/>
	<combobox>
	<comboitem label="Simple and Rich"/>
	<comboitem label="Cool!"/>
	<comboitem label="Thumbs Up!"/>
	</combobox>
</window>
